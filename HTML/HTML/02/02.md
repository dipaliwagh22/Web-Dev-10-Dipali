Objective: Learn how to use basic HTML tags.

Headings and Paragraphs

Create a new HTML file named elementary-tags.html.

Define the basic structure of an HTML document.

Inside the body tag, add h1 to h6 tags with different content for each heading level. Add a p tag below each heading with content describing that heading.

Adding Line Breaks and Horizontal Lines Below the paragraph tags, add a br tag. Add another paragraph with the content "This is a new line after a break.".

Below this paragraph, add an hr tag. Inserting Images Below the horizontal line, add an img tag with the src attribute set to the URL of an image and the alt attribute set to "Sample Image".

Creating Links Below the image, add an a tag with the href attribute set to "https://www.example.com" and the content "Visit Example".
